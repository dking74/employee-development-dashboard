Technology employees everywhere are looking for always looking for ways to advance in their careers and let their employers know that they are taking such efforts. This project will attempt to develop a universal platform that will be a one-stop shop for employees to do just this: advance their careers through training and events while easily allowing their employers to see the progress they make. While the primary purpose is to serve the employees, a secondary purpose will be through the eyes of employers as a way to have employee promotions and end-of-year reviews. The portal will allow employees to sign up for events that will allow them to learn and network with other employees; the portal will allow for an array of training videos that can give employees technical skills they need; the portal will allow for tracking achievements, certifications, goals, and provide feedback.
